"""Card lifecycle phase — explicit state machine with enforced transitions.

Design rationale (aligned with openclaw-lark StreamingCardController):
- Explicit PHASE_TRANSITIONS map defines legal transitions
- Terminal phases have no outgoing transitions (absorbing states)
- TerminalReason tracks WHY a session ended
- create_epoch prevents stale creation callbacks from corrupting state
- should_proceed() unifies terminal + unavailable + phase checks
